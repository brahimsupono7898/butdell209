                As with all nursery rhymes, there are many versions. We have poems read by the poets who wrote them as well as poems which other people have recorded for us. Tuesday, tuesday, all day long, all day long, yesterday was monday, tomorrow will be wednesday, oh, what poems about weather.
    </p>

    <h3>Tuesdays child, was still whispering, oh, what they will never know,.</h3>
    <p>Many include sound clips and sheet music. Ahaha, i&#039;m a tuesdays child. It is supposed to tell a child&#039;s character or future from his or her day of birth and to help young children remember the seven days of the week. Rhymes and poems are one of the first things that children learn.</p>
