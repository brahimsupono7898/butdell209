    <h3>Lawrence, of virtuous father john milton.</h3>
    <p>A message to my father jerry hughes. He was shot 4 times in his back. Nevertheless, not as i will, but as thou willest. hebrews 5:7 during the days of jesus&#039; earthly life, he offered up prayers and petitions with loud cries and tears to the one who could save him from death, and he was heard. I was searching for words to add to my father&#039;s tribute.</p>
