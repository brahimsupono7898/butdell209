                My mind is at ease, my soul is at rest. I hear a voice that whispers &#039;grieve not for me&#039;. The family (erma bombeck) we were a strange little band of characters trudging through life sharing diseases and toothpaste, coveting one another&#039;s desserts, hiding shampoo, borrowing money, locking each other out of our rooms, inflicting pain and kissing to heal it in the same instant, loving, laughing, defending, and trying to figure out the common thread that bound us all together.
    </p>

    <h3>I wonder if they love me of if i&#039;m even missed.</h3>
    <p>Keep on smiling the sun will shine through. Mcbride when anger and unforgiveness invade the very crevices of your heart it burns fierce like sulfur as it forces love to depart. I originally wrote the poem called a broken family tree 12 years ago. Like branches on a tree we all grown in different directions, yet our roots remain as one.</p>
