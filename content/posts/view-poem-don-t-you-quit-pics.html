    <h3>When care is pressing you down a bit, rest, if you must, but don&#039;t you quit.</h3>
    <p>There are many times in life when we feel. This poem reminds us that there are seeds of success in every failure, and that&#039;s why we mustn&#039;t quit. When things go wrong, as they sometimes will, when the road you&#039;re trudging seems all uphill, when the funds are low and the debts are high, and you want to smile, but you have to sigh, when care is pressing you down a bit, rest if you must, but don&#039;t you quit. The poem, don&#039;t you quit was very inspirational to me.</p>
