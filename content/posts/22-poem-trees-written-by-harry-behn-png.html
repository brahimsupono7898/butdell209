    <p>He continued to write poems and songs and began a commonplace book in 1783, while his father fought a legal dispute with his landlord. Trees are the kindest things i know. The moon has a face like the clock in the hall, she shines on thieves on the garden wall, on streets and fields and harbour quays, and birdies asleep in the forks of the trees.
